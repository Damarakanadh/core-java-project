# Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, class-based programming language designed to be platform-independent. It is one of the most widely used languages for building enterprise applications, mobile apps, web apps, desktop tools, and distributed systems.

It's Core Principle is " Write Once, Run Anywhere"(WORA). meaning java code can run on any devices or Operating System that has a "Java Virtual Machine(JVM)".


## Key Characteristics

- **Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)** - Java supports OOP concepts to create modular and reusable code.
- **Platform Independent** – Java programs can runs on any operating system with a JVM.
- **Secure & Robust** – Java ensures reliability and security through Strong memory management and error (or) exception handling.
- **Portable** – Java bytecode works across platforms.
- **Multithreading and Concurrency** – Java allows concurrent execution of multiple tasks for effciency.
- **Rich API and Standard Libraries** – Large standard library for utilities, data structures, I/O, networking, etc. Java provides extensive built-in libraries for various programming needs.
- **Frameworks for Enterprise and Web Development** - Java Supports frameworks that simplify enterprise and web application development.
- **Open-Source Libraries** - Java has a wide range of libraries to extend functionality and  speed up development.
- **Maintainability and Scalability** - Java's structured design allows easy maintenance and growth of applications.

## Java Applications
- Enterprise applications (AEM, Spring)
- Android apps
- Web applications
- Financial systems
- Big data applications

Java remains popular because of its reliability, huge ecosystem, and long-term community support.

## What Can We Do with Java?
Java is used for:
- **Mobile App Development** - Android development using Android Studio.
- **Web Development** - Using frameworks like [Spring], [Spring_Boot], [Struts], [Hibernate].
- **Destop GuI Applications** - With libraries like [JavaFX], [Swing].
- **Enterprise Applications** - Backbone of banking, ERP and large-scale business software.
- **Game Development** - With engines like LibGDX and jMonkeyEngine.
- **Big Data Technologies** - Like [Hadoop] and [Apache_Kafka].
- **Internet of Things(IoT)** - Java can run on embedded systems and devices.
- **Cloud-based Applications** - Java is used in services on [AWS], [Azure], [Google_Cloud].
- **Scientific Applications** - Java is used in tools that process large amounts of          scientific data.
